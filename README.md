This example uses the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.
It allows you to enter tasks, select alarm times, and add them to a to-do list. 
The alarms are not implemented as actual alarms; instead, they are displayed in the list. 
You can enhance this example by adding a feature to trigger alarms at the specified times using the threading or schedule library, for example.
